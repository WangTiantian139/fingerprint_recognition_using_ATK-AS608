# fingerprint_recognition_using_ATK-AS608
## Requires 
pyserial
## Description
A very simple hardware-depending module for recognizing fingerprint using ATK-AS608 comunicating through serial. 
Actually this project is just like serial talker, sending or receiving message to or from ATK-AS608, who collecting, processing, recognizing and storing fingerprint. However, only a subset of the hardware's functions has been implemented.
